Executive decisions
--------------------------------------------

- Bill: Raw species richness: control for area? (Fig 1, Results part about hotspots)
- against: 
    1) we have no good way of doing it.
    2) hotspots are not really about "relatively high number of species" - we would only get small islands as hotspots, and thats not what a hotspots is about


--> area standard -> stand hotspots

- Alex: use mapcurves algorithm to get more quantitative hypotheses of overlap etc.... not sure if useful here: "Mapcurves is a quantitative method to compare the spatial concordance between categorical maps, by calculating a goodness of fit (GOF) for each polygon in a map of interest based on the degree of spatial overlap with the polygons of a reference map. The results can be summarized in a global GOF score": compares categorical maps
We have mostly numerical


- Bill: is low SES.PE indicative of neoendemism?
 --> are we using these terms, given the australians working on that.
