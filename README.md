# Global hotspots of plant phylogenetic diversity

## Summary
A global analysis of phylogenetic diversity focused on seed plants (Spermatophyta). The analyses capitalises
on the recently completed World Checklist of Vascular Plants [1], a publicly
accessible, comprehensive taxonomic checklist of vascular plants and their geographic
distributions, in conjunction with a complete phylogeny of seed plants.

This work is currently in review with New Phytologist.

## Content
This repo contains all code necessary to repeat the study. Since some steps include computation-intense steps (e.g. supplementing the phylogeny with TACT), we also provide some processed data files to enable skipping the data preparation steps.

All analysis were done in R version 4.2.1 (R Core Team, 2022). 

Upon publication, this repo will be archived on Zenodo.

## Notes on computational requirements
### TACT
Adding missing taxa to the phylogenetic tree with TACT [2] takes about 80 hours and requires 150GB RAM for each run. Due to the stochastic nature of the procedure, we ran TACT 100 times, and calculated the phylogeny-derived estimates as average values from all 100 trees.
